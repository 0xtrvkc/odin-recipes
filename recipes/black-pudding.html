<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Black pudding is a distinct regional type of blood sausage originating in the United Kingdom and Ireland. It is made from pork or beef blood, with pork fat or beef suet, and a cereal, usually oatmeal, oat groats, or barley groats. The high proportion of cereal, along with the use of certain herbs such as pennyroyal, serves to distinguish black pudding from blood sausages eaten in other parts of the world.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>2 litres of fresh pigs blood</li>
    <li>500g of diced back fat, slightly sweated</li>
        <li> 250g of sliced onions, finely chopped and gently sweated</li>
            <li> 2 heaped tbsp of oatmeal, soaked in water overnight</li>
                <li>1 heaped tsp of white pepper</li>
                    <li> 1 heaped tbsp of salt</li>
                        <li> 1 heaped tsp of ground mixed spice (such as coriander, cumin & ginger)</li>
                            <li>500 ml of double cream</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
   <li> Sieve the pig's blood, into a large container, to remove any clots.</li>

   <li> Add the sweated back fat and the fried onions to the blood. Mix in well.</li>
    
    <li> Then stir in the oatmeal, white pepper, salt, spice and double cream. When the ingredients are thoroughly mixed, it's time to fill the casings.</li>
    
        <li> Tie a knot on over one end of a casing - leaving a long length of string as a "tail". </li>
    
            <li> The funnel can become clogged. Use a chopstick or something similar to clear any blockage.</li>
    
                <li> Take the tail of the piece of string and use it to tie a second knot in the other end of the casing. You should have a nice U-shaped pudding. Complete filling the rest of the casings.</li>
    
                    <li> Bring a large pan filled with two-thirds of unsalted water to the boil and then turn the heat down to a very gentle simmer. Add each pudding to the water.</li>
    
                        <li>  Prick the pudding occasionally times with a needle. If a brown liquid comes out, the pudding is done. This should take about 20 minutes. Leave the pudding to cool and then slice and serve.</li>

</ol>
