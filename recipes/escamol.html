<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Escamoles, or ant larvae, is a dish native to Central Mexico. It was once considered a delicacy by the Aztecs—insect caviar, if you will (their price today continues to reflect this high-minded status). As far as insect-related pre-Hispanic foods go, this one is better than it sounds. The light-colored ant eggs, harvested from maguey plants, resemble white-corn kernels or pine nuts; they have a poppy texture (more crunchy if fried) and a slightly nutty taste. Often pan-fried with butter and spices, escamoles can be found in tacos and omelets or served alone, accompanied by guacamole and tortillas. It’s indigenous, tasty, and memorable, without the gross-out factor (for those unfamilar to the cuisine) of, say, fried maguey worms, another common pre-Hispanic insect food.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
   <li> 2 cup escamoles</li>
   <li>2 serrano peppers</li>
    <li>1/2 onion</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
            <li>2 epazote sprigs</li>
                <li>1/2 stick butter</li>
                    <li>1/2 tablespoon salt</li>


</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Put in a strainer 2 cups of escamoles, rinse them and remove any rubbish that you find, then reserve. If you are using canned escamoles is not necessary to rinse them.</li>
    <li>Put the following on a griddle over medium heat: 2 serrano peppers, 2 garlic cloves. If you want to experience a milder salsa, remove the seeds and the veins of the chilies.</li>
    <li>Roast the garlics for approximately 1 minute and the chilies for about 3 minutes, until all their sides are moderately roasted; move them regularly with some tongs.</li>
    <li>Transfer from the griddle to a blender (with the tongs) the ingredients that were roasted. Also add in the blender 1/4 cup of water (2 fl oz).</li>
    <li>Blend the ingredients well and reserve.</li>
    <li>Finely chop 1/2 onion and 2 epazote sprigs; then reserve.</li>
    <li>Melt butter in a frying pan over low heat. Add in the frying pan the onion that was minced and fry it for approximately 1 minute, until it looks a bit transparent; stir regularly.</li>
    <li>Incorporate in the frying pan the escamoles that were rinsed. Mix the ingredients and fry them for about 2 minutes, until the escamoles acquire a white color; stir occasionally.</li>
    <li>Add in the frying pan the mixture that was blended, and the epazote that was minced, and 1/2 tablespoon of salt.</li>
    <li>Mix the frying pan ingredients and fry the escamoles salsa for about 4 minutes, until it thickens a little; stir occasionally.</li>
